# This is description of the profile project

I want to add some text to this file to preview different features of markdown, so I can create good view of this things in my site.

## Some code for no reason

```typescript
let variable = 'Not a constant'
const constant = 42

function itIsTooHard() {
  if (constant === 42) {
    variable = constant.toString()
  } else {
    variable = 'In is not the answer'
  }
}
```

## Next is the list

- I think
  1. it should
  2. be a list
- or no
  - I don't know how
  - it works properly
    - But I'm trying

## And the image

### Header 3 I think is enough

I should add some text here so it doesn't look like fuck.\
I don't understand

## And quotes in the end
