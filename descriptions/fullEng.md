# Idea

I wanted to create my portfolio so that any people could easily and quickly find out about me, my hobbies and my projects. And of course, I think this project is a good practice for creating web applications. I couldn't miss the chance to add such a project to my piggy bank.

# Preparation

### Creating an architecture

The first stage in creating this project was inventing the architecture of the project and selecting the necessary libraries that I might need. I immediately decided that I would use [react](), despite my desire to work with [vue](), I decided that I would use a framework more familiar to me for my portfolio. As the main libraries, of course, I used [router]() for routing and [redux]() as a global data store.

I also decided that I would not use the library UI because I wanted my portfolio to have its own style. As an exception, I decided to add [react bootstrap]() only to use containers with their breakpoints, so that it would be easier to create an adaptive layout. I also couldn't refuse [styled]() in any way because of its convenience and from [framer]() because of the exciting animations, which are also very easy to register directly in [js]().

I decided to store the data using [firebase](), as this service seemed to me quite simple and convenient to use. Initially I wanted to store all the data on [cloud firestore](), but in the process I thought that all my pet projects would obviously exist on [github](), so I decided to store the project description and related images directly in my repositories and use [github api](). I thought it would be more convenient, but we'll see how it will manifest itself in the future.

### Filling

Initially, I wanted to fill my portfolio directly with my projects with a brief description and a page about myself.

I also believe that every site needs to have dark and light interface themes. Even if we assume that the user will not use switching these topics, it is important that the user sees the page as he wants to see it. So, if a user uses a dark theme in his operating system or in his browser, then the site must meet this requirement. So when the site is loaded for the first time, the user will be satisfied that the theme of the site corresponds to his preferences.

I also immediately decided that I would adapt the site to two languages, because, again, this is a user's preference, but it is also a good practice for me. To add language support, I decided to use the [i18n]() library, as I had heard about it before. But then I realized that the functionality that I used could be implemented myself without any problems.

# Creation process

The creation process was not something extraordinary. I learned [redux]() and [router]() better and got more practice. I don't know what else can be said about the process of creating an application, except that at that time the semester of study was coming to an end and writing code faded into the background, so the creation process was a little delayed.

### Difficulties

When writing the code, I certainly encountered minor difficulties. But probably the main difficulty that I encountered, we can say, does not apply to this project. This complexity of filling with content. I would like the pages about the projects not to be empty, but since I write a description of the projects after the end of their creation, a lot of interesting points about their creation are forgotten and there is not much to write about. In addition, there are mostly test tasks here, about which there is not much to say at all. From now on, I think I will try to record interesting moments and difficulties that I encountered in the process of creating a particular project.

# Conclusion

It was interesting to create this project at the beginning, but due to the fact that it stretched for a long time due to the session and the closure of debts, at the end I already wanted to finish it as soon as possible and go to try to find good vacancies and do other pet projects in parallel, because I still have ideas. The loss of interest also affected the quality of the code, which does not please me, so I will try to create pet projects in a shorter time. In addition, I think that we need to speed up the layout stage by creating a project design, because layout on the go greatly slows down the creation of the project. Moreover, I want to focus more on working with asynchrony, different apis and working with redux.

Since I'm tired of writing project descriptions, for now the English version of this text will be the translator's version, not mine, then I'll correct it. So I'm sorry if you're reading this in English.
