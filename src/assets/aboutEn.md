# Introduction

I am Sayfulloev Kareem and I want to become a frontend developer. I'm learning [js]() and developing programs using it about 2 years. And about a year ago I decided to use [typescript]() and to be honest I like it more. I'll tell about my skills and experience further, and more about me in the end.

# Skills

I'm using different technologies in development but I prefer to use [react](). I also use [router](), [redux](), [styled](), [motion]() along with it. I like to use my own styles and create app identity by myself. Becouse of that I don't use UI libraries usually but I used some of that. For example, I [mui]() and [bootstrap]() were being used in my projects. I also worked with [vue]() but I think I prefer [react](). Thanks to it, I worked with [next]() and [gatsby](). I also used [css]() preprocessor [sass]() but for now I work with [styled]().

If we are talking not about frontend, I worked with python for a while. I created simple programs with it. For example one time I found interesting neural network with wich you can process images. I created telegram bot and with both of it I could process my images anywhere.

# Experience

I have some experience in web apps developing, but unfortunately it's still non-commercial. On my [crawraps]() profile you can see my pet projects. Obviously not everything I've ever created is there, some of my pet projects are on forgotten hard drives. Now I understand that I am ready and I want on full-fledget commercial projects, work in a team of professionals.

# More about me

I've started diving into the worls of computer technology about 4 years ago. After two years, after learning more about IT I decided that I want to develop in frontend. I like the idea that I can create something functional and beautiful with my own hands. Of course I didn't all the subtleties then but I was already creating my own sites using only [js]() [html]() and [css](). In the process I found new technologies, and my interest in this area grew with increasing force. I learned about [css]() preprocessors, [js]() frameworks, build systems and about [github](). For the next two years I fully immersed in frontend and by now I realize that I already feel confident in programming and now I want to turn my hobby into the job which will allow me to develop and learn different subtleties faster.

The main operating system for me has long been [linux](). I was interested in learning more about the operation of OS, so I decided to install it and explore it. After I figured it out, I was able to configure it to fit my needs. I realized that I would not return to [windows]() as my main OS because the console has become my best friend. I was hooked on the possibility of flexible configuration and the idea of how mush I can learn using it as the main OS.

My interest in programming prompted me to enroll in one of the best, as I thought at that time, technical universities in the country - Bauman Moscow state technival university. And now I'm actively looking for a job.

So if you have read up to this point, then I dare to assume that you are interested in my candidacy and sisnce you spaent a few minutes reading all this information I hope you will invite me to an interview or send me a test assignment. Thank you â™¥
